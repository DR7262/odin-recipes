<p>Gambas al ajillo are on every Spanish restaurant menu — for good reason! It's a dish of shrimp cloaked in garlic-infused olive oil with smoky hints of paprika and a touch of sweetness from sherry.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound frozen large shrimp (21-25 count) - thawed, peeled, and deveined</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon hot smoked paprika (Optional)</li>
    <li>kosher salt to taste</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons dry sherry</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped Italian flat-leaf parsley</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Place shrimp in a large bowl and season with paprika and kosher salt; mix well to coat.</li>
    <li>Slice garlic into thin slices. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat; add garlic and cook until golden, about 2 minutes. Add shrimp and increase heat to high. Toss and turn shrimp with tongs until starting to curl but still undercooked, about 2 minutes. Pour in sherry. Cook, stirring continuously, until sauce comes up to a boil and shrimp is cooked through, about 1 minute more. Remove from heat. Stir in parsley.</li>
